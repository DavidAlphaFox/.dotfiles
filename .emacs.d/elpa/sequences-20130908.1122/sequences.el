;;; Commentary:

;; Ports of Clojure sequence functions that I find useful to have
;; around. Maybe others will too?

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(defun sequences-tree-seq (branch? children root)
  (cl-labels ((walk (node)
                    (cons node
                          (if (funcall branch? node)
                              (cl-mapcan #'walk (cddr (funcall children node)))))))
    (walk root)))

(defun sequences-file-seq (root)
  (sequences-tree-seq 'file-directory-p
                      (lambda (directory)
                        (directory-files directory t))
                      (expand-file-name root)))
